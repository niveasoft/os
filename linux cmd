Theory: The Linux command is a utility of the Linux operating system. All basic and advanced tasks can be done by executing commands. The commands are executed on the Linux terminal. The terminal is a command-line interface to interact with the system, which is similar to the command prompt in the Windows OS. Commands in Linux are case- sensitive.
Linux provides a powerful command-line interface compared to other operating systems such as Windows and MacOS. We can do basic work and advanced work through its terminal. We can do some basic tasks such as creating a file, deleting a file, moving a file, and more. In addition, we can also perform advanced tasks such as administrative tasks (including package installation, user management), networking tasks (ssh connection), security tasks, and many more.
Linux terminal is a user-friendly terminal as it provides various support options. To open the Linux terminal, press "CTRL + ALT + T" keys together, and execute a command by pressing the 'ENTER' key.
Linux Directory Commands
1. pwd Command
The pwd command is used to display the location of the current working directory. Syntax:
Pwd
2. mkdir Command
 
 The mkdir command is used to create a new directory under any directory.
Syntax:
1. mkdir <directory name>
3. rmdir Command
The rmdir command is used to delete a directory.
Syntax:
1. rmdir <directory name>
4. ls Command

Syntax:
ls
5. cd Command
The cd command is used to change the current directory.
Syntax:
1. cd <directory name>
Linux File commands
6. touch Command
The touch command is used to create empty files. We can create multiple empty files by executing it once.
Syntax:
1. touch <file name>
7. cat Command
The cat command is a multi-purpose utility in the Linux system. It can be used to create a file, display content of the file, copy the content of one file to another file, and more.
Syntax:
   
 1. cat [OPTION]... [FILE]..
To create a file, execute it as follows:
1. cat > <file name> // Enter file content
Press "CTRL+ D" keys to save the file. To display the content of the file, execute it as follows:
cat <file name> 8. rm Command
The rm command is used to remove a file.
Syntax:
rm <file name>
9. cp Command
The cp command is used to copy a file or directory.
Syntax:
To copy in the same directory:
cp <existing file name> <new file name>
10. mv Command
The mv command is used to move a file or a directory form one location to another location.
Syntax:
1. mv <file name> <directory path>
Linux File Content Commands 11. head Command
The head command is used to display the content of a file. It displays the first 10 lines of a file.
Syntax:
1. head <file name> 12. tail Command
The tail command is similar to the head command. The difference between both commands is that it displays the last ten lines of the file content. It is useful for reading the error message.
 
 Syntax:
1. tail <file name> 13. tac Command
The tac command is the reverse of cat command, as its name specified. It displays the file content in reverse order (from the last line).
Syntax:
1. tac <file name> 14. more command
The more command is quite similar to the cat command, as it is used to display the file content in the same way that the cat command does. The only difference between both commands is that, in case of larger files, the more command displays screenful output at a time.
In more command, the following keys are used to scroll the page: ENTER key: To scroll down page by line.
Space bar: To move to the next page.
b key: To move to the previous page.
/ key: To search the string. Syntax:
1. more <file name> 15. less Command
The less command is similar to the more command. It also includes some extra features such as 'adjustment in width and height of the terminal.' Comparatively, the more command cuts the output in the width of the terminal.
Syntax:
1. less <file name>
Linux User Commands
16. The su command provides administrative access to another user. In other words, it allows access of the Linux shell to another user.
Syntax:
1. su <user name> 17. id Command
The id command is used to display the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID).
Syntax:
  
 1. id
18. useradd Command
The useradd command is used to add or remove a user on a Linux server.
Syntax:
1. useradd username
19. passwd Command
The passwd command is used to create and change the password for a user.
Syntax:
1. passwd <username> 20. groupadd Command
The groupadd command is used to create a user group.
Syntax:
1. groupadd <group name>
Linux Filter Commands 22. cut Command
The cut command is used to select a specific column of a file. The '-d' option is used as a delimiter, and it can be a space (' '), a slash (/), a hyphen (-), or anything else. And, the '-f' option is used to specify a column number.
Syntax:
1. cut -d(delimiter) -f(columnNumber) <fileName>
23. comm Command
The 'comm' command is used to compare two files or streams. By default, it displays three columns, first displays non-matching items of the first file, second indicates the non-matching item of the second file, and the third column displays the matching items of both files.
Syntax:
1. comm <file1> <file2> 24. tee command
The tee command is quite similar to the cat command. The only difference between both filters is that it puts standard input on standard output and also write them into a file.
Syntax:
1. cat <fileName> | tee <newFile> | cat or tac |..... 25. tr Command
The tr command is used to translate the file content like from lower case to upper case.
    
 Syntax:
1. command | tr <'old'> <'new'> 26. uniq Command
The uniq command is used to form a sorted list in which every word will occur only once.
Syntax:
1. command <fileName> | uniq 27. wc Command
The wc command is used to count the lines, words, and characters in a file.
Syntax:
1. wc <file name>
28. od Command
The od command is used to display the content of a file in different s, such as hexadecimal, octal, and ASCII characters.
 Syntax:
1. od -b <fileName>
2. od -t x1 <fileName>
3. od -c <fileName>
29. sort Command

Linux Utility Commands 31. find Command
The find command is used to find a particular file within a directory. It also supports various options to find a file such as byname, by type, by date, and more.
The following symbols are used after the find command: (.) : For current directory name
(/) : For root
   
 Syntax:
1. find . -name "*.pdf"
32. locate Command
The locate command is used to search a file by file name. It is quite similar to find command; the difference is that it is a background process. It searches the file in the database, whereas the find command searches in the file system. It is faster than the find command. To find the file with the locates command, keep your database updated.
